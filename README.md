# Her [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/remiprev/her.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/remiprev/her) [![Gem dependency status](https://gemnasium.com/remiprev/her.png?travis)](https://gemnasium.com/remiprev/her)

Her is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that maps REST resources to Ruby objects. It is designed to build applications that are powered by a RESTful API instead of a database.

## Installation

In your Gemfile, add:

```ruby
gem "her"
```

That’s it!

## Usage

First, you have to define which API your models will be bound to. For example, with Rails, you would create a new `config/initializers/her.rb` file with these lines:

```ruby
# config/initializers/her.rb
Her::API.setup :url => "https://api.example.com" do |connection|
  connection.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

And then to add the ORM behavior to a class, you just have to include `Her::Model` in it:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end
```

After that, using Her is very similar to many ActiveRecord-like ORMs:

```ruby
User.all
# GET https://api.example.com/users and return an array of User objects

User.find(1)
# GET https://api.example.com/users/1 and return a User object

@user = User.create(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
# POST "https://api.example.com/users" with the data and return a User object

@user = User.new(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
@user.occupation = "actor"
@user.save
# POST https://api.example.com/users with the data and return a User object

@user = User.find(1)
@user.fullname = "Lindsay Fünke"
@user.save
# PUT https://api.example.com/users/1 with the data and return+update the User object
```

### ActiveRecord-like methods

These are the basic ActiveRecord-like methods you can use with your models:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end

# Update a fetched resource
user = User.find(1)
user.fullname = "Lindsay Fünke"
# OR user.assign_attributes :fullname => "Lindsay Fünke"
user.save

# Update a resource without fetching it
User.save_existing(1, :fullname => "Lindsay Fünke")

# Destroy a fetched resource
user = User.find(1)
user.destroy

# Destroy a resource without fetching it
User.destroy_existing(1)

# Fetching a collection of resources
User.all
User.where(:moderator => 1).all

# Create a new resource
User.create(:fullname => "Maeby Fünke")

# Save a new resource
user = User.new(:fullname => "Maeby Fünke")
user.save
```

You can look into the `examples` directory for a sample application using Her. For a complete reference of all the methods you can use, check out [the documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/remiprev/her).

## Middleware

Since Her relies on [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) to send HTTP requests, you can choose the middleware used to handle requests and responses. Using the block in the `setup` call, you have access to Faraday’s `connection` object and are able to customize the middleware stack used on each request and response.

### Authentication

Her doesn’t support authentication by default. However, it’s easy to implement one with request middleware. Using the `connection` block, we can add it to the middleware stack.

For example, to add a token header to your API requests in a Rails application, you could use the excellent [`request_store`](https://rubygems.org/gems/request_store) gem like this:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_filter :set_user_api_token

  protected
  def set_user_api_token
    RequestStore.store[:my_api_token] = current_user.api_token # or something similar based on `session`
  end
end

# lib/my_token_authentication.rb
class MyTokenAuthentication < Faraday::Middleware
  def call(env)
    env[:request_headers]["X-API-Token"] = RequestStore.store[:my_api_token]
    @app.call(env)
  end
end

# config/initializers/her.rb
require "lib/my_token_authentication"

Her::API.setup :url => "https://api.example.com" do |connection|
  connection.use MyTokenAuthentication
  connection.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

Now, each HTTP request made by Her will have the `X-API-Token` header.

### OAuth

Using the `faraday_middleware` and `simple_oauth` gems, it’s fairly easy to use OAuth authentication with Her.

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "her"
gem "faraday_middleware"
gem "simple_oauth"
```

In your Ruby code:

```ruby
# Create an application on `https://dev.twitter.com/apps` to set these values
TWITTER_CREDENTIALS = {
  :consumer_key => "",
  :consumer_secret => "",
  :token => "",
  :token_secret => ""
}

Her::API.setup :url => "https://api.twitter.com/1/" do |connection|
  connection.use FaradayMiddleware::OAuth, TWITTER_CREDENTIALS
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end

class Tweet
  include Her::Model
end

@tweets = Tweet.get("/statuses/home_timeline.json")
```

See the *Authentication* middleware section for an example of how to pass different credentials based on the current user.

### Parsing JSON data

By default, Her handles JSON data. It expects the resource/collection data to be returned at the first level.

```javascript
// The response of GET /users/1
{ "id" : 1, "name" : "Tobias Fünke" }

// The response of GET /users
[{ "id" : 1, "name" : "Tobias Fünke" }]
```

However, if you want Her to be able to parse the data from a single root element (usually based on the model name), you’ll have to use the `parse_root_in_json` method (See the **JSON attributes-wrapping** section).

Also, you can define your own parsing method using a response middleware. The middleware should set `env[:body]` to a hash with three symbol keys: `:data`, `:errors` and `:metadata`. The following code uses a custom middleware to parse the JSON data:

```ruby
# Expects responses like:
#
#     {
#       "result": {
#         "id": 1,
#         "name": "Tobias Fünke"
#       },
#       "errors" => []
#     }
#
class MyCustomParser < Faraday::Response::Middleware
  def on_complete(env)
    json = MultiJson.load(env[:body], :symbolize_keys => true)
    env[:body] = {
      :data => json[:result],
      :errors => json[:errors],
      :metadata => json[:metadata]
    }
  end
end

Her::API.setup :url => "https://api.example.com" do |connection|
  connection.use MyCustomParser
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

### Caching

Again, using the `faraday_middleware` and `memcached` gems makes it very easy to cache requests and responses.

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "her"
gem "faraday_middleware"
gem "memcached"
```

In your Ruby code:

```ruby
Her::API.setup :url => "https://api.example.com" do |connection|
  connection.use FaradayMiddleware::Caching, Memcached::Rails.new('127.0.0.1:11211')
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end

class User
  include Her::Model
end

@user = User.find(1)
# GET /users/1

@user = User.find(1)
# This request will be fetched from memcached
```

## Advanced Features

Here’s a list of several useful features available in Her.

### Associations

You can define `has_many`, `has_one` and `belongs_to` associations in your models. The association data is handled in two different ways.

1. If Her finds association data when parsing a resource, that data will be used to create the associated model objects on the resource.
2. If no association data was included when parsing a resource, calling a method with the same name as the association will fetch the data (providing there’s an HTTP request available for it in the API).

For example:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  has_many :comments
  has_one :role
  belongs_to :organization
end

class Comment
  include Her::Model
end

class Role
  include Her::Model
end

class Organization
  include Her::Model
end
```

If there’s association data in the resource, no extra HTTP request is made when calling the `#comments` method and an array of resources is returned:

```ruby
@user = User.find(1)
# {
#   :id => 1,
#   :name => "George Michael Bluth",
#   :comments => [
#     { :id => 1, :text => "Foo" },
#     { :id => 2, :text => "Bar" }
#   ],
#   :role => { :id => 1, :name => "Admin" },
#   :organization => { :id => 2, :name => "Bluth Company" }
# }
@user.comments
# [#<Comment id=1 text="Foo">, #<Comment id=2 text="Bar">]
@user.role
# #<Role id=1 name="Admin">
@user.organization
# #<Organization id=2 name="Bluth Company">
```

If there’s no association data in the resource, Her makes a HTTP request to retrieve the data.

```ruby
@user = User.find(1)
# { :id => 1, :name => "George Michael Bluth", :organization_id => 2 }

# has_many association:
@user.comments
# GET /users/1/comments
# [#<Comment id=1>, #<Comment id=2>]

@user.comments.where(:approved => 1)
# GET /users/1/comments?approved=1
# [#<Comment id=1>]

# has_one association:
@user.role
# GET /users/1/role
# #<Role id=1>

# belongs_to association:
@user.organization
# (the organization id comes from :organization_id, by default)
# GET /organizations/2
# #<Organization id=2>
```

Subsequent calls to `#comments`, `#role` and `#organization` will not trigger extra HTTP requests and will return the cached objects.

#### Notes about paths

Resources must always have all the required attributes to build their complete path. For example, if you have these models:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  collection_path "organizations/:organization_id/users"
end

class Organization
  include Her::Model
  has_many :users
end
```

Her expects all `User` resources to have an `:organization_id` (or `:_organization_id`) attribute. Otherwise, calling mostly all methods, like `User.all`, will thrown an exception like this one:

```ruby
Her::Errors::PathError: Missing :_organization_id parameter to build the request path. Path is `organizations/:organization_id/users`. Parameters are `{ … }`.
```

### Validations

Her includes `ActiveModel::Validations` so you can declare validations the same way you do in Rails.

However, validations must be triggered manually — they are not run, for example, when calling `#save` on an object, or `#create` on a model class.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model

  attributes :fullname, :email
  validates :fullname, :presence => true
  validates :email, :presence => true
end

@user = User.new(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
@user.valid? # => false

@user.save
# POST /users&fullname=Tobias+Fünke will still be called, even if the user is not valid
```

### Dirty attributes

Her includes `ActiveModel::Dirty` so you can keep track of the attributes that have changed in an object.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model

  attributes :fullname, :email
end

@user = User.new(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
@user.fullname_changed? # => true
@user.changes # => { :fullname => [nil, "Tobias Fünke"] }

@user.save
# POST /users&fullname=Tobias+Fünke

@user.fullname_changed? # => false
@user.changes # => {}
```

### Callbacks

You can add *before* and *after* callbacks to your models that are triggered on specific actions. You can use symbols or blocks.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  before_save :set_internal_id
  after_find { |u| u.fullname.upcase! }

  def set_internal_id
    self.internal_id = 42 # Will be passed in the HTTP request
  end
end

@user = User.create(:fullname => "Tobias Funke")
# POST /users&fullname=Tobias+Fünke&internal_id=42

@user = User.find(1)
@user.fullname # => "TOBIAS FUNKE"
```

The available callbacks are:

* `before_save`
* `before_create`
* `before_update`
* `before_destroy`
* `after_save`
* `after_create`
* `after_update`
* `after_destroy`
* `after_find`

### JSON attributes-wrapping

Her supports *sending* and *parsing* JSON data wrapped in a root element (to be compatible with Rails’ `include_root_in_json` setting), like so:

#### Sending

If you want to send all data to your API wrapped in a *root* element based on the model name.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  include_root_in_json true
end

class Article
  include Her::Model
  include_root_in_json :post
end

User.create(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
# POST { "user": { "fullname": "Tobias Fünke" } } to /users

Article.create(:title => "Hello world.")
# POST { "post": { "title": "Hello world." } } to /articles
```

#### Parsing

If the API returns data wrapped in a *root* element based on the model name.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  parse_root_in_json true
end

class Article
  include Her::Model
  parse_root_in_json :post
end

# POST /users returns { "user": { "fullname": "Tobias Fünke" } }
user = User.create(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
user.fullname # => "Tobias Fünke"

# POST /articles returns { "post": { "title": "Hello world." } }
article = Article.create(:title => "Hello world.")
article.title # => "Hello world."
```

Of course, you can use both `include_root_in_json` and `parse_root_in_json` at the same time.

### Custom requests

You can easily define custom requests for your models using `custom_get`, `custom_post`, etc.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  custom_get :popular, :unpopular
  custom_post :from_default
end

User.popular
# GET /users/popular
# [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]

User.unpopular
# GET /users/unpopular
# [#<User id=3>, #<User id=4>]

User.from_default(:name => "Maeby Fünke")
# POST /users/from_default?name=Maeby+Fünke
# #<User id=5 name="Maeby Fünke">
```

You can also use `get`, `post`, `put` or `delete` (which maps the returned data to either a collection or a resource).

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end

User.get(:popular)
# GET /users/popular
# [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]

User.get(:single_best)
# GET /users/single_best
# #<User id=1>
```

Also, `get_collection` (which maps the returned data to a collection of resources), `get_resource` (which maps the returned data to a single resource) or `get_raw` (which yields the parsed data return from the HTTP request) can also be used. Other HTTP methods are supported (`post_raw`, `put_resource`, etc.).

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model

  def self.popular
    get_collection(:popular)
  end

  def self.total
    get_raw(:stats) do |parsed_data|
      parsed_data[:data][:total_users]
    end
  end
end

User.popular
# GET /users/popular
# [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]
User.total
# GET /users/stats
# => 42
```

You can also use full request paths (with strings instead of symbols).

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end

User.get("/users/popular")
# GET /users/popular
# [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]
```

### Custom paths

You can define custom HTTP paths for your models:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  collection_path "/hello_users/:id"
end

@user = User.find(1)
# GET /hello_users/1
```

You can also include custom variables in your paths:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  collection_path "/organizations/:organization_id/users"
end

@user = User.find(1, :_organization_id => 2)
# GET /organizations/2/users/1

@user = User.all(:_organization_id => 2)
# GET /organizations/2/users

@user = User.new(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke", :organization_id => 2)
@user.save
# POST /organizations/2/users
```

### Custom primary keys

If your record uses an attribute other than `:id` to identify itself, specify it using the `primary_key` method:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  primary_key :_id
end

user = User.find("4fd89a42ff204b03a905c535") # GET /users/1 returns { "_id": "4fd89a42ff204b03a905c535", "name": "Tobias" }
user.save # PUT /users/4fd89a42ff204b03a905c535
```

### Inheritance

If all your models share the same settings, you might want to make them children of a class and only include `Her::Model` in that class.

```ruby
module MyAPI
  class Model
    include Her::Model

    parse_root_in_json true
    include_root_in_json true
  end
end

class User < MyAPI::Model
end

User.find(1)
# GET /users/1
```

### Multiple APIs

It is possible to use different APIs for different models. Instead of calling `Her::API.setup`, you can create instances of `Her::API`:

```ruby
# config/initializers/her.rb
MY_API = Her::API.new
MY_API.setup :url => "https://my-api.example.com" do |connection|
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end

OTHER_API = Her::API.new
OTHER_API.setup :url => "https://other-api.example.com" do |connection|
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

You can then define which API a model will use:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  use_api MY_API
end

class Category
  include Her::Model
  use_api OTHER_API
end

User.all
# GET https://my-api.example.com/users

Category.all
# GET https://other-api.example.com/categories
```

### SSL

When initializing `Her::API`, you can pass any parameter supported by `Faraday.new`. So [to use HTTPS](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday/wiki/Setting-up-SSL-certificates), you can use Faraday’s `:ssl` option.

```ruby
ssl_options = { :ca_path => "/usr/lib/ssl/certs" }
Her::API.setup :url => "https://api.example.com", :ssl => ssl_options do |connection|
  connection.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  connection.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

## Testing

Suppose we have these two models bound to your API:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User
  include Her::Model
  custom_get :popular
end

# app/models/post.rb
class Post
  include Her::Model
  custom_get :recent, :archived
end
```

In order to test them, we’ll have to stub the remote API requests. With [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core), we can do this like so:

```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include(Module.new do
    def stub_api_for(klass)
      klass.use_api (api = Her::API.new)

      # Here, you would customize this for your own API (URL, middleware, etc)
      # like you have done in your application’s initializer
      api.setup :url => "http://api.example.com" do |connection|
        connection.use Her::Middleware::FirstLevelParseJSON
        connection.adapter(:test) { |s| yield(s) }
      end
    end
  end)
end
```

Then, in your tests, we can specify what (fake) HTTP requests will return:

```ruby
# spec/models/user.rb
describe User do
  before do
    stub_api_for(User) do |stub|
      stub.get("/users/popular") { |env| [200, {}, [{ :id => 1, :name => "Tobias Fünke" }, { :id => 2, :name => "Lindsay Fünke" }].to_json] }
    end
  end

  describe :popular do
    subject { User.popular }
    its(:length) { should == 2 }
    its(:errors) { should be_empty }
  end
end
```

We can redefine the API for a model as many times as we want, like for more complex tests:

```ruby
# spec/models/user.rb
describe Post do
  describe :recent do
    before do
      stub_api_for(Post) do |stub|
        stub.get("/posts/recent") { |env| [200, {}, [{ :id => 1 }, { :id => 2 }].to_json] }
      end
    end

    subject { Post.recent }
    its(:length) { should == 2 }
    its(:errors) { should be_empty }
  end

  describe :archived do
    before do
      stub_api_for(Post) do |stub|
        stub.get("/posts/archived") { |env| [200, {}, [{ :id => 1 }, { :id => 2 }].to_json] }
      end
    end

    subject { Post.archived }
    its(:length) { should == 2 }
    its(:errors) { should be_empty }
  end
end
```

## Upgrade

## Her IRL

Most projects I know that use Her are internal or private projects but here’s a list of public ones:

* [tumbz](https://github.com/remiprev/tumbz)
* [crowdher](https://github.com/simonprev/crowdher)

## History

I told myself a few months ago that it would be great to build a gem to replace Rails’ [ActiveResource](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html) since it was barely maintained (and now removed from Rails 4.0), lacking features and hard to extend/customize. I had built a few of these REST-powered ORMs for client projects before but I decided I wanted to write one for myself that I could release as an open-source project.

Most of Her’s core codebase was written on a Saturday morning of April 2012 ([first commit](https://github.com/remiprev/her/commit/689d8e88916dc2ad258e69a2a91a283f061cbef2) at 7am!).
