module Her
  # This module is the main element of Her. After creating a Her::API object,
  # include this module in your models to get a few magic methods defined in them.

  # @example
  #   class User
  #     include Her::Model
  #     uses_api $api
  #   end
  #
  #   @user = User.new(:name => "RÃ©mi")
